# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing desktop meeting minutes application (Meetily) into a web-based application that runs on Railway.app with Microsoft Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication. The current application is a Tauri-based desktop app with a Python FastAPI backend that processes meeting audio locally using Whisper for transcription and various LLMs for summarization. The redesigned system will maintain core functionality while transitioning to a cloud-hosted, multi-tenant web application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Web Application Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the meeting minutes application through a web browser, so that I can use it from any device without installing desktop software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the web application URL THEN the system SHALL display a responsive web interface
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL provide the same core functionality as the desktop version through a web browser
3. WHEN accessed from different devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface appropriately for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
4. WHEN the user interacts with the application THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates without requiring page refreshes

### Requirement 2: Microsoft SSO Authentication

**User Story:** As an organization user, I want to sign in using my Microsoft account, so that I can securely access the application using my existing corporate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL redirect unauthenticated users to Microsoft SSO login
2. WHEN a user completes Microsoft SSO authentication THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve their user profile and grant access
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them to re-authenticate
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and redirect to the login page
5. IF a user's Microsoft account is disabled THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3: Railway.app Deployment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application deployed on Railway.app, so that it can be easily managed, scaled, and maintained in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run successfully on Railway.app infrastructure
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale to handle the load
3. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variable configuration
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all required services and dependencies
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 4: Multi-tenant Data Isolation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my meeting data to be private and isolated from other users, so that my organization's sensitive information remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or accesses meetings THEN the system SHALL only show data belonging to that user
2. WHEN storing meeting data THEN the system SHALL associate all data with the authenticated user's identity
3. WHEN querying the database THEN the system SHALL filter all results by user ownership
4. IF a user attempts to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN a user is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated meeting data

### Requirement 5: Cloud-based Audio Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload audio files for transcription, so that I can process meeting recordings without requiring local Whisper installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an audio file THEN the system SHALL accept common audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC)
2. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL use cloud-hosted Whisper for transcription
3. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL store the results and notify the user
4. IF audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and handle timeouts gracefully

### Requirement 6: Session Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my sessions to be secure and properly managed, so that my data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a secure session with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
3. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL use secure, encrypted storage
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication
5. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the expiration and prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 7: Database Migration and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use a cloud database, so that data is persistent, backed up, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway
2. WHEN storing meeting data THEN the system SHALL use proper database schemas with user isolation
3. WHEN the database schema changes THEN the system SHALL support automated migrations
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and graceful degradation
5. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexes and query optimization

### Requirement 8: File Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded audio files and generated content to be securely stored, so that I can access them reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads files THEN the system SHALL store them in secure cloud storage
2. WHEN accessing stored files THEN the system SHALL verify user ownership before granting access
3. WHEN files are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide cleanup mechanisms
4. IF storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide options to manage storage
5. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL serve them securely with appropriate access controls

### Requirement 9: Real-time Processing Status

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the progress of my audio processing, so that I know when my meeting summary will be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio processing starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN processing status changes THEN the system SHALL update the user interface in real-time
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user and display results
4. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL show error details and recovery options
5. WHEN multiple files are processing THEN the system SHALL show individual status for each

### Requirement 10: API Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to maintain API compatibility, so that existing integrations continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from desktop to web THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API endpoints where possible
2. WHEN API changes are necessary THEN the system SHALL provide backward compatibility or clear migration paths
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL extend the API without breaking existing functionality
4. IF API authentication changes THEN the system SHALL support both old and new authentication methods during transition
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error responses and logging
